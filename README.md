This app is to-do but not basic as i am not only going to use only react . I am going to use full MERN stack .

THINGS THAT I WILL USE
1> Good frontend design
2> html,css ,js 
3> I will use react with usestate, useeffect, http requests with axios library .
4> In Backend Express.js will be used 
5> database will be MongoDB 
6> so moongoose library is sure to be used without any doubt 

APP FEATERS :
1> SIGN IN ,SIGN OUT, PROFILE WITH BASIC DATA , DELETE ACCOUNT OPTION 
2> TO-DO LIST with edit,delete,update feature
